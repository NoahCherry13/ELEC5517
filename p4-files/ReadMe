This directory contains 3 types of files:
- p4 file
- p4runtime files
- topology json

The p4 file is what defines the dataplane flow for the switches. It contains all matching tables, the logic for packet ingress, egress, emission, and the state machine.

The runtime json files define the switch specific logic and parameters

The topology file defines the links, switches, and the mapping of p4 runtime files to the switches.

## How to Run It
1) Open the p4 tutorial virtual machine
2) Navigate to /home/p4/tutorials/exercises/basic
3) Replace the existing basic.p4 with the basic.p4 in this directory
4) Navigate to pod-topo directory
5) Copy over all updated runtime files
6) Replace topology.json with the corresponding file in this directory
7) Navigate back to /home/p4/tutorials/exercises/basic
8) Run "make build && make run"
9) Always run "make stop" after exiting mininet to ensure correct shutdown
